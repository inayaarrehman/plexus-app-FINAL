// Anatomical Plexus glyphs (Systems redesign). "Medicine gives each system
// its shape; Plexus draws that shape through connections." Every system has a
// hand-authored constellation of nodes + thin paths that suggests its organ
// or biological form WITHOUT being a conventional organ icon, filled
// silhouette, emoji, or stock SVG — the shape is legible only from the
// ARRANGEMENT of the network. One cohesive family: similar node size, stroke,
// density, bounding box (~20–80 within a 0–100 viewBox) and 9–12 nodes each.
//
// Each glyph is fully deterministic and static. Progress is layered on at
// render time: the whole network is ALWAYS faintly visible (§20); a prefix of
// `order` resolves (brightens/enlarges) in proportion to the system's real
// X/Y, and a path resolves once BOTH its endpoints have, so the network
// propagates through the anatomy along a fixed sequence (§21–22).
//
// `order` lists node indices in resolution sequence and MUST contain every
// node index exactly once; each newly-resolved node should connect to one
// already resolved so the lit region stays contiguous.
